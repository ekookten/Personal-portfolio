Erkan Okten's Portfolio

Description

This is my personal portfolio website that showcases my skills, work, and projects as a junior web developer. The website is built with HTML and CSS and features responsive design using Flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. It contains an About section, a Work section displaying my projects with links to live versions and GitHub repositories, and a Contact section where users can send me messages.
